# Nodule Generation Algorithm

This codebase implements a simple baseline model, by following the main steps in the [paper](https://geertlitjens.nl/publication/litj-10-a/litj-10-a.pdf) published by Litjens et al. for nodule generation track in [NODE21](https://node21.grand-challenge.org/). It contains all necessary files to build a docker image which can be submitted as an algorithm on the [grand-challenge](https://www.grand-challenge.org) platform. Participants in the generation track can use this codebase as a template to understand how to create their own algorithm for submission.

To serve this algorithm in a docker container compatible with the requirements of grand-challenge, 
we used [evalutils](https://github.com/comic/evalutils) which provides methods to wrap your algorithm in Docker containers. 
It automatically generates template scripts for your container files, and creates commands for building, testing, and exporting the algorithm container.
We adapted this template code for our algorithm by following the
[general tutorial on how to create a grand-challenge algorithm](https://grand-challenge.org/blogs/create-an-algorithm/). 

Before diving into the details of this template code we recommend readers have the pre-requisites installed and have cloned this repository as described on the 
[main README page](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21), and that they have gone through 
the [general tutorial on how to create a grand-challenge algorithm](https://grand-challenge.org/blogs/create-an-algorithm/). 

The details of how to build and submit the baseline NODE21 nodule generation algorithm using our template code are described below.

## An overview of the baseline algorithm
The baseline nodule generation algorithm is based on the [paper](https://geertlitjens.nl/publication/litj-10-a/litj-10-a.pdf) published by Litjens et al.. The main file executed by the docker container is [*process.py*](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration/process.py). 


## Input and output interfaces
The algorithm needs to generate nodules on a given chest X-ray image (CXR) at requested locations (given in a .json file) and return a CXR after placing nodules. The nodule generation algorithm takes as input a chest X-ray (CXR) and a nodules.json file, which holds the coordinates location of where to generate the nodules. The algorithm reads the input :
* CXR at ```"/input/<uuid>.mha"```
* nodules.json file at ```"/input/nodules.json"```.

and writes the output to:
```/output/<uuid>.mha```

The nodules.json file contains the predicted bounding box locations and associated nodule likelihoods (probabilities). 
This file is a dictionary and contains multiple 2D bounding boxes coordinates 
in [CIRRUS](https://comic.github.io/grand-challenge.org/components.html#grandchallenge.components.models.InterfaceKind.interface_type_annotation) 
compatible format. The coordinates are expected in milimiters when spacing information is available. 
An example nodules.json file is as follows:

```python
{
    "type": "Multiple 2D bounding boxes",
    "boxes": [
        {
        "corners": [
            [ 92.66666412353516, 136.06668090820312, 0],
            [ 54.79999923706055, 136.06668090820312, 0],
            [ 54.79999923706055, 95.53333282470703, 0],
            [ 92.66666412353516, 95.53333282470703, 0]
        ]},
        {
        "corners": [
            [ 92.66666412353516, 136.06668090820312, 0],
            [ 54.79999923706055, 136.06668090820312, 0],
            [ 54.79999923706055, 95.53333282470703, 0],
            [ 92.66666412353516, 95.53333282470703, 0]
        ]}
    ],
    "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 }
}
```
The implementation of the algorithm inference in process.py is straightforward (and must be followed by participants creating their own algorithm): 
load the nodules.json file in the [*__init__*](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration/process.py#L25) function of the class, 
and implement a function called [*predict*](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration/process.py#L44) 
to generate nodules on a given CXR image. 

The function [*predict*](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration/process.py#L44) is run by 
evalutils when the [process](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration/process.py#L108) function is called. 

ðŸ“Œ NOTE: In order to run this codebase, nodule_patches folder should contain all the ct nodule patches and corresponding segmentation maps, which are provided in the zenodo release of NODE21.
     (Here we provide just one patch and its segmentation as an example.)
     If you would like to run this algorithm, please copy all the provided ct nodule patches and segmentations together in to the nodule_patches folder. 

ðŸ’¡ To test this container locally without a docker container, you should the **execute_in_docker** flag to 
False - this sets all paths to relative paths. You should set it back to **True** when you want to switch back to the docker container setting.

### Operating on a 3D image
For the sake of time efficiency in the evaluation process of [NODE21](https://node21.grand-challenge.org/), 
the submitted algorithms to [NODE21](https://node21.grand-challenge.org/) are expected to operate on a 3D image which consists of multiple CXR images 
stacked together. The algorithm should go through the slices (CXR images) one by one and process them individually, 
as shown in [*predict*](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration/process.py#L62). 
When outputting results, the third coordinate of the bounding box in nodules.json file is used to identify the CXR from the stack. 
If the algorithm processes the first CXR image in 3D volume, the z coordinate output should be 0, if it processes the third CXR image, it should be 2, etc.

### Configure the Docker file

<a name="export"/>

### Build, test and export your container
1. Switch to the correct algorithm folder at algorithms/nodulegeneration. To test if all dependencies are met, you can run the file build.bat (Windows) / build.sh (Linux) to build the docker container. 
Please note that the next step (testing the container) also runs a build, so this step is not necessary if you are certain that everything is set up correctly.

    *build.sh*/*build.bat* files will run the following command to build the docker for you:
    ```python 
   
    docker build -t nodulegenerator .
    ```

2. To test the docker container to see if it works as expected, *test.sh*/*test.bat* will run the container on images provided in  ```test/``` folder, 
and it will check the results (*results.json* produced by your algorithm) against ```test/expected_output.json```. 
Please update your ```test/expected_output.json``` according to your algorithm result when it is run on the test data. 
   ```python
   . ./test.sh
   ```
    If the test runs successfully you will see the message **Tests successfully passed...** at the end of the output.

    Once you validated that the algorithm works as expected, you might want to simply run the algorithm on the test folder 
    and check the output images for yourself.  If you are on a native Linux system you will need to create a results folder that the 
    docker container can write to as follows (WSL users can skip this step) (Note that $SCRIPTPATH was created in the previous test script).
    ```python
   mkdir $SCRIPTPATH/results
   chmod 777 $SCRIPTPATH/results
   ```
   To write the output of the algorithm to the results folder use the following command (note that $SCRIPTPATH was created in the previous test script): 
   ```python
   docker run --rm --memory=11g -v $SCRIPTPATH/test:/input/ -v $SCRIPTPATH/results:/output/ nodulegenerator
   ```
   

4. Run *export.sh*/*export.bat* to save the docker image which runs the following command:
   ```python
    docker save nodulegenerator | gzip -c > nodulegenerator.tar.gz
   ```
     
 <a name="submit"/>

    
 ### Submit your algorithm
 Once you have your docker image ready (.tar.gz file), you are ready to submit! Let us walk you through the steps you need to follow to upload and submit your algorithm to [NODE21](https://node21.grand-challenge.org/) generation track:

1. In order to submit your docker container, you first have to create an algorithm entry for your docker container [here](https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/create/).
   * Please choose a title for your algorithm and add a (squared image) logo. Enter the modalities and structure information as in the example below.
      ![alt text](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/images/gen_algorithm_description.PNG)

    * Scrolling down the page, you will see that you need to enter the information regarding the interface of the algorithm. Please select *Generic Medical Image (Image)* and *Nodules (Multiple 2D Bounding Boxes)* as Inputs and *Generic Medical Image (Image)* as Outputs. Do not forget to pick the workstation as *Viewer CIRRUS Core (Public)*. 
      ![alt text](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/images/gen_algorithm_interfaces.PNG)
  
2. After saving it, you are ready to upload your docker container. Choose the container tab, and upload your container. You can also overwrite your container by uploading a new one. That means that when you make changes to your algorithm, you could overwrite your container and submit the updated version of your algorithm to node21:
    ![alt text](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/images/gen_algorithm_uploadcontainer.PNG)

3. OPTIONAL: Please note that it can take a while (several minutes) until the container becomes active. Once it becomes active, we suggest that you try out the algorithm to verify everything works as expected. For this, please click on *Try-out Algorithm* tab, and upload a *Generic Medical Image* and paste your *nodules.json* file. To paste your nodules.json content, please click on tree and select "code" then paste the content of your json file. You could upload the image and nodules.json given in the test folder which represents how test data would look like during evaluation.
  ![alt text](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/blob/main/images/gen_algorithm_tryout.PNG)
4. OPTIONAL: You could look at the results of your algorithm: click on the *Results*, and *Open Result in Viewer* to visualize the results. You would be directed to CIRRUS viewer, and the results will be visualized with the predicted bounding boxes on chest x-ray images as below. You could move to the next and previous slice (slice is a chest x-ray in this case) by clicking on the up and down arrow in the keyboard.
