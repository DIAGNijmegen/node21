Welcome to the **algorithms** page!  Participants in the [NODE21](https://node21.grand-challenge.org/) challenge are required to make their submission 
by creating and submitting an algorithm on our [grand-challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/) platform.   We additionally request that the code for your algorithm
should be available in a **public GitHub repository** with an [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) present in the root folder.
You can provide the repository URL when creating your algorithm.

A general tutorial on how to create an algorithm for grand-challenge is provided
[here](https://grand-challenge.org/blogs/create-an-algorithm/) .  We recommend participants follow this tutorial to get an understanding of the process.

In addition to the tutorial, in this repository we provide template code for NODE21 participants for both the detection and generation tracks. These templates allow you to build working algorithms which comply with the requirements of 
grand-challenge and of NODE21 (specifically the input and output interfaces required for NODE21 challenge submissions). We encourage you to adapt these
templates to run your own method or to model your docker image on them.

To work with the template code please first ensure you have the pre-requisites installed and have cloned this repository as described on the 
[main README page](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21).  Then head to the template algorithm for 
[nodule detection](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/tree/main/algorithms/noduledetection) or 
[nodule generation](https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/node21/tree/main/algorithms/nodulegeneration) depending on 
which track you would like to submit to.
